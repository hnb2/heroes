NOW
===
- Implements items (data + controler + command = info, use, throw) interfaces ? Usable, Throwable...
- Make the 'to' clickable with the name (check position.js for current impl)

EXTRA
=====
- Simple webapp to create json data file (form, create object, JSON.stringify, html5 file storage ?)

LATER
=====
- Export gcli into another file after boostarting the app in "app.js"
- Make an option for restart (linked with the death of the hero)
- Reorganize the js ext files (create a root gcli ? Set utils inside gcli ? Be able to use a built version later)

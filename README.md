NOW
===
- Make the 'to' clickable with the name (check position.js for current impl)
- Make an option for restart (linked with the death of the hero)
- Export gcli into another file after boostarting the app in "app.js"
- Implements items (data + controler + command = info, use, throw) interfaces ? Usable, Throwable...

LATER
=====
- Reorganize the js ext files (create a root gcli ? Set utils inside gcli ? Be able to use a built version later)

NOW
===
- Try to make the HTML/DOM output possible
- Make the 'to' clickable with the name
- Make an option for restart (linked with the death of the hero)
- Export gcli into another file after boostarting the app in "app.js"

LATER
=====
- Add distinct CSS file
- Reorganize the js ext files (create a root gcli ? Set utils inside gcli ? Be able to use a built version later)

NOW
===
- Find a way to implement the use() content of the function (meta/description language like saved queries in redmine)
- Add content in the map.json for the rooms upstairs and the wolves
- Add content in the map.json for the key, the manor and the wolf leader
- Make the 'to' clickable with the name (check position.js for current impl)
- Implement the gold coins

EXTRA
=====
- Simple webapp to create json data file (form, create object, JSON.stringify, html5 file storage ?)

LATER
=====
- Export gcli into another file after boostarting the app in "app.js"
- Make an option for restart (linked with the death of the hero)
- Reorganize the js ext files (create a root gcli ? Set utils inside gcli ? Be able to use a built version later)
